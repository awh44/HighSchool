# Car State Game

The code in this folder is for a statistics based "racing game" in Visual Basic 6. It is based on the racing game [here](http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/RacingGameWithOneDie/), though with a number of enhancements. The game essentially works as follows. The user specifies a number of cars between two and six to participate in a "race" and a number of "segments" to occur in this race. They can then either specify on which dice rolls each car will move forward a "segment" or they may enter a raw percentage for the same. They can then either manually "roll the die" to move one of the cars forward a segment, or they may enter a large number of runs all to be done at once. Either way, the game will keep track of statistics regarding which car has won which percentage of races. This is displayed to the user, and it can also be visualized in a pie chart. This program was used by the computer science teacher in his AP statistics course to talk about and visualize compound probabilities, even being used as the basis for a (very difficult) homework assignment, as well as for the visualization of experimental probabilities.

In a Visual Basic 6 IDE, the game should theoretically be runnable. Though loading the project file may cause a number of errors to appear, the project still seems runnable. The only function issue that arises is that an up/down control to change the number of segments in the race does not appear. However, this folder contains an executable, Racing Game.exe, created before this issue arose that seems to run fine on Windows 7 and should, hopefully, run fine on other machines as well.

Below is a screenshot of the game in action.
