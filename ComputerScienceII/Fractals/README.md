# Fractals

This folder contains a project that contains a number of different recursive fractal implementations, including Sierpinski triangles and tree shapes that can be paramterized with lengths and angle of the subtrees. The project might load with errors in
Visual Basic 6, but it will still run correctly. Additionally, the Fractals.exe executable should work fine as well; it at least seems to on Windows 7.
