# Smart Games

Uses the fact that tic-tac-toe is a solved game to have an "AI" play against the user. Either the computer or the user can go first, and at worst, if the player plays perfectly, the game will end in a tie, or, if the player makes a mistake, the computer will win.

Smart Tic-tac-toe.exe is an executable version of the program.
