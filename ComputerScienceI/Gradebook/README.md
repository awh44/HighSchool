# Gradebook

This looks like it might have been the second project I ever completed, after the pay check one. while much more ambitious, that also means that it is much more messy, as an early project. The general gist of this project is that the user can enter any number of assignments for all of their classes, have the program automatically compute their average for each quater, and then have it both calculate the average for the course, given a final exam grade, and a total GPA, taking into account both course weights and AP/honors/regular course standing.

While the connection between the assignments and the "report card" form does work, the required order of button presses certainly is not intuitive, and neither is the tab order on all of the controls. The "interesting" and "fun" aspect of this project was that I worked out the math needed to add a scroll bar to allow for more assignments than can fit in a single screen's worth of a frame, though, testing it now, some of the controls end up misaligned. The "Open" and "Save" buttons on the report card form are for an earlier version of the program, when it was used to teach different concepts by the teacher, so they don't actually work.

The Gradebook.exe file is an exectuable version, if a VB IDE isn't readibly available.
