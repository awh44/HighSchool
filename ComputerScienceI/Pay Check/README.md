#Pay Check

This is literally the first programming project I ever did, in my first week of 10th grade. It's a simple Visual Basic program that given a number of hours worked and the pay rate calculates the earned total for the week. It will also subtract out various taxes and display the totals of these values for the user.

The program should theoretically be runnable from within the VB6 IDE without any erorrs, and Paycheck.exe is an exectuable version of the program.
